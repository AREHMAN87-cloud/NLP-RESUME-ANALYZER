# üìÑ Resume Screening App using NLP

This is a simple web app built with **Flask** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to classify resumes into different categories (e.g., Data Scientist, Web Developer, etc.) based on their content.

## üöÄ Features
- Upload **PDF** or **TXT** resumes.
- Automatically extracts and processes text.
- Classifies the resume using a pre-trained ML model (SVM + TF-IDF).
- Simple and clean HTML interface with CSS styling.

## üß† How It Works
The model uses:
- `TF-IDF` vectorizer for converting text to numerical data.
- `SVM` classifier for prediction.
- `LabelEncoder` for converting category labels.

All trained components are saved using `pickle`:
- `tfidf.pkl` (text vectorizer)
- `clf.pkl` (classifier)
- `encoder.pkl` (label encoder)

These files are saved **locally** in the same directory where your training notebook or script is executed.

## üìÇ File Structure
```
Resume screening APP/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tfidf.pkl
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clf.pkl
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ encoder.pkl
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure all `.pkl` files are in the **same directory** as `app.py`. If you organize files into folders, update the file paths accordingly in your `app.py`.

## üõ† How to Run
1. Install requirements:
   ```
   pip install flask PyPDF2 scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the Flask app:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
